Stable:
* Introduction / Design
* Quick Start
* Psuedo-Distributed Mode (node configuration via master)
** Simple web interface
** Agent/collector roles
* Fully-Distributed Mode section:
** Static configuration of failover chains.
** Single master Memory-Backed and Zookeeper-Backed Configuration
   Store.
* Data model of Flume event
* Output Bucketing with the CollectorSink
* Flume's Dataflow language
* Flume Shell

Stabilizing:
* Fully-Distributed Mode:

** Disk failover mode and End-to-end modes 
** DFO and E2E retransmission is unstable when connected to a network
   sink.
* Sink/Source/Decorator Plugins

Active Development:
* Automatic versions of failover.

* Multiple Flume Masters
* Output Formatting options
* Custom metadata extraction

Known Bugs
* ZK session timeout makes master unrecoverable 
* Shell does not provide useful feedback on errors
* Translated configurations are not always auto-updated when logical
