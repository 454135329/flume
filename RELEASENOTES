Flume 0.9.2 (Unreleased)
========================

Flume 0.9.2 is *not backwards compatible* with <0.9.2 installations
due to FLUME-216 - this release changes how configurations and node
maps are persisted to ZooKeeper and 0.9.2 masters cannot read
configurations or node maps written by masters from <0.9.2
installations. There is no upgrade path yet to preserve both node maps
and configurations, but one is planned for the 0.9.2 release.


Flume 0.9.1 Release Notes
=========================   

This release of Flume implements the core framework and has
implementations of most of the major features of the Flume system
described in the Flume User Guide. Some sections are stable, while
others are under active development. We also list several known bugs
and instabilities.

Supported platforms: Linux, requires Java 1.6, not tested on windows

Stable:
* Introduction / Design
* Quick Start
* Psuedo-Distributed Mode (node configuration via master)
** Simple web interface
** Agent/collector roles
* Fully-Distributed Mode section:
** Static configuration of failover chains.
** Single master Memory-Backed and Zookeeper-Backed Configuration
   Store.
* Data model of Flume event
* Output Bucketing with the CollectorSink
* Flume's Dataflow language
* Flume Shell

Stabilizing:
* Fully-Distributed Mode: 
** Modes for unreliable network conditions in testing
** Disk failover mode and End-to-end modes 
** DFO and E2E retransmission is unstable when connected to a network
   sink.
* Sink/Source/Decorator Plugins

Active Development:
* Automatic versions of failover.
* Logical Naming translations.
* Multiple Flume Masters
* Output Formatting options
* Custom metadata extraction

Known Bugs
* ZK session timeout makes master unrecoverable 
* Shell does not provide useful feedback on errors
* Translated configurations are not always auto-updated when logical
  nodes are newly spawned onto physical nodes.  An extra 'refreshAll'
  command may need to be executed.
* Two collectorSources on the same node sometimes fails to translate
  the more recent collectorSource
* Logical node names must be unique
* Logical nodes with the same name as the physical nodes on which they
  run cannot be deleted
